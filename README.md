# Libft - 1337 School Custom C Library

## Overview
**Libft** is a custom implementation of essential C library functions and additional utility functions, developed as part of the 1337 School curriculum. The goal of this project is to strengthen understanding of low-level programming concepts, memory management, and reusable code design. This library will serve as the foundation for future projects.

---

## Features
- Reimplementation of standard `libc` functions, such as `strlen`, `strcpy`, and `memcpy`.
- Custom utility functions for advanced string manipulation, memory allocation, and more.
- Linked list manipulation functions to handle dynamic data structures.
- Fully compliant with **Norminette**, the 42/1337 coding style standard.

---

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
To use this library, you need:
- A working C compiler, such as `gcc`.
- A UNIX-like operating system (Linux, macOS).

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/mkatfi/libft.git
   cd libft


2. Build the library:
   ```bash
   make
   ```

   This will generate a `libft.a` file, which is your compiled static library.

---

## Usage
To use **Libft** in your projects:

1. Include the header file in your code:
   ```c
   #include "libft.h"
   ```

2. Compile your program with the library:
   ```bash
   gcc -Wall -Wextra -Werror your_program.c libft.a -o your_program
   ```

3. Run your program:
   ```bash
   ./libft
   ```

## Project Structure

### Mandatory Part - Libc Functions
Reimplementations of basic C standard library functions. Examples include:
- **String Functions**: `ft_strlen`, `ft_strcpy`, `ft_strjoin`
- **Memory Functions**: `ft_memset`, `ft_memcpy`, `ft_memmove`
- **Character Checks**: `ft_isalpha`, `ft_isdigit`, `ft_tolower`

### Additional Functions
Additional utilities not included in the standard library:
- **String Utilities**: `ft_substr`, `ft_strtrim`, `ft_split`
- **Number Conversion**: `ft_itoa`
- **Memory Management**: `ft_calloc`

### Bonus Part - Linked List Functions
Functions to manipulate linked lists:
- `ft_lstnew`: Create a new list node.
- `ft_lstadd_front`: Add a node at the beginning.
- `ft_lstiter`: Iterate through the list and apply a function.
